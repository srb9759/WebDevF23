> **Recipe for a flaky Chicken Pot Pie**
> *Ingredients*
1. 4 tbsp. Butter
2. 1/2 c. finely diced onion
3. 1/2 c. finely diced carrot
4. 1/2 c. finely diced celery
5. 3 c. shredded cooked chicken or turkey
6. 1/4 c. flour
7. 3 c. low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed
8. Splash of white wine (optional)
9. 1/4 tsp. turmeric
10. Salt and pepper, to taste
11. Chopped fresh thyme to taste
12. 1/4 c. half-and-half or cream
13. 1 whole unbaked pie crust
14. 1 whole egg
> *Instructions*
1. Preheat the oven to 375ºF.
2. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat, then add the onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 3 minutes.
3. Stir in the chicken or turkey, then sprinkle the flour over top and stir it until it's all combined with the meat and vegetables. Cook for 1 minute, then pour in the chicken broth (and wine, if using). Stir and let it cook and thicken. Once it starts to thicken add the turmeric, salt, pepper, and thyme.
4. Add the half-and-half or cream, then stir the mixture and let it bubble and thicken, about 3 minutes. If it seems overly thick, splash in a little more broth. Turn off the heat.
5. Pour the filling into a 2-quart baking dish. Roll out the pie crust on a floured surface and lay it over the top of the dish. Press the dough so the edges stick to the outside of the pan. Use a knife to cut little vents here and there in the surface of the dough.
6. Mix together the egg with 2 tablespoons of water and brush it all over the surface of the crust. (You will have some egg wash left over.)
7. Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. To prevent the crust from getting too brown, you might want to cover it lightly with foil for the first 15 minutes of baking time.
8. Serve it up by the big ol' spoonful!
