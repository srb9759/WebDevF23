                        <p>My name is Sofia Battista and I am an aspiring UX designer. 
                        I spent my undergraduate at New York University where I focused in Integrated Digital Media. 
                        I have a background in computer science which has fueled my passion to integrate computer coding into my UX designs. 
                        Throughout my undergraduate career I have had numerous opportunities to create both hands-on and digital designs which
                        have built up my skills using a wide variety of tools. I am extremely passionate about creating wearable medical devices 
                        for individuals with disabilities. Growing up my father worked in construction where he focused on creating more accessible 
                        housing and inclusive working environments, in particular focusing on people with disabilities. Over the years I have helped 
                        him with these projects and got to see first hand how a disability can affect someone's daily life. My dads years of work inspired 
                        me to carry on his efforts in helping those in need by creating devices that help revolutionize medical prosthesis. My goal is to come 
                        back to New York City after graduation to work hand in hand with the NYU Langone Center for Amputation Reconstruction to make big strides in the field.
