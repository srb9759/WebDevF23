For my midterm I plan on creating a portfolio website that holds all of my work I have done from the past 3 years 
    Home Page
        - The home page will consist of of floating circles that have slight movement to it
        - When you hover over the circle it gets bigger and the orientation of the circle moves to the center of the page
        - I want the circles to always be slightly bobbing in the space and the center circle is changing depending on which circle you are currently over
        - Each subpage will lead to another page corresponding to the topic listed on the circle but a new window doesn't pop up instead it will stay on the same window and just change its page
        - Within the subpage there will be a small nav bar that is stuck to the bottom of the screeen so even when you scroll the nav bar stays 
        - The nav bar once pressed will lead the viewer back to the home page with the floating orbs 
    I will have 3 subpages 
        -About Me Page
            - Inlcudes photo and description about me
        -Audio Design (stuff from audio foundation studio)
            - Audio gallery with my work
            - I want to figure out how to embedd audio files so you don't have to navigate to a different link just to listen to the audio
        -Physical designs (my heart to heart table, stuff made in wearables)
            - will include a description of my experience and then a photo gallery the user can go through to see my work 
            - Each photo will have a description of the work 
        -Graphic Design (this section will have my graphic design pieces in a gallery)
            - will include a description of my experience and then a photo gallery the user can go through to see my work 
            - Each photo will have a description of the work
