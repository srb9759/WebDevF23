            <h2>Heart To Heart</h2>
            <p>My first project for the course Special Topics in Digital Media  was a headphone table that used a heart rate monitor on one side of the table that connected to 8ohm speakers on the other side of the table which was amplified through holes cut into the table. The project is supposed to connect two people through the sounds of one persons heart beating from a distance away. Given the recent pandemic I thought it was fitting to create distance in between people but to still find a way to keep the connected in the end. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To create the project I built a table that would act as a hollow speaker to amplify the pulse. The table was made out of birch and treated plywood and was shaped into a coffin. The table top was connect to the sides using  hinges so that the speaker and sensor could be adjusted as needed. Inside of the table was insulation that was used to trap the noise inside of the box so that the sound only could travel up through the holes. The final piece to creating the speaker was using tubing to create adjustable headphones for the user. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Along with construction elements the table consisted of artistic pieces on both the side and top of the table. The top of the table had a design that was originally made up on procreate and was transferred using acrylic paint to the top. As for the art on the side spray paint and paper stencils were used.
