            <p>My first assignment for my Audio Foundation course was to take all of the tracks of a given song and order them and edit them in a way that made the song sound whole. I was given Holocene by Bon Iver which I have never heard before. I never listened to the original song while making the mix because I didn't want my mix to be biased to how the original artist set up the song. I used the application Reaper to create this mix. This assignment helped me become knowledgable on the basics of music production. I learned how to use send tracks, volume control, reverb, EQ levels, and panning to be able to layer the sound tracks.

                <p>The final assignment for Audio Foundation Studio was to create a sound collage from scratch. Using inspiration from living in the city I created a sound collage of the sounds of the city. I used recorded sound bites and online sounds to create a piece that sounds like you are standing on the corner of a busy and rainy street in the city. This final assignment used a collection of tools learned throughout the course to create one final piece.

                    <p>This was the second assignment for my Audio Foundation course. The goal of the assignment was to make a professional quality podcast that utilized room tone to record our own voices. I did my podcast based off of the super natural events of the Amityville Horror. This assignment allowed me to become more proficient in the tools used in assignment one along with automation of volume and noise reduction techniques.

                    <p>This was the third assignment for my Audio Foundation course. This assignment was to help us learn how to sync up soundbites to a video. We had to create the audio backing to a Better Call Saul  clip. Taking sound bites from online and recording our own sound bites we were able to sync up the sounds and edit them to give the most realistic sound track to the video. This assignment helped give me experience is ADR and sound bite recording and editing
